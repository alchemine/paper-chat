      "- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.\n",
      "- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like \"the article discusses\".\n",
      "- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article. \n",
      "- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.\n",
      "- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. \n",

      "Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.\n",
